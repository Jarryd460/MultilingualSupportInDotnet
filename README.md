# Multilingual Support in Dotnet

### Description

Enabling multilingual support in .Net applications is quite simple. .Net has multilingual support built into it. By default, it uses .resx files to manage translations with each .resx file containing translations for a specific file.
You could categorize translations further by creating .resx for each controller, model etc.
